I've found, as I get a little older, that I am discovering a new found pleasure in learning. Learning for learning's sake - just about anything. I have found myself craving new skills and these are fairly various and wide-ranging in their scope - everything from being able to type fairly serviceably (having been useless at this for almost all my life) to learning to play the piano and understanding chord progressions, the pentatonic scale, blues harmonies and other assorted fun things. None of this is particularly revelatory, and nor is it (I imagine) particularly uncommon to find yourself thirsting for new skills at this point in one's life. But here I am, and I'm revelling in the challenge of it all. There you go...nothing earth-shattering, but the best I could come up with late on a Tuesday evening. 

'Til next time, friends...over and out.
