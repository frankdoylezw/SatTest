When you first start to type, you deliberately place your fingers in a rather slow and cumbersome manner above the keys, your movements slow and unsure. Given some time and concentrated practice, however, I have started to see marked improvement and am finally able to experience the subconscious, 'undirected' placing of the fingers that I was told would happen. Intrigued by this well-known phenomenon and wanting to exercise more of my brain, I would like to learn to play piano - in a manner not dissimilar to learning to type. The repeated, subconscious reaching for specific keys to achieve an outcome - either words on a page or musical notes. Watch this space for more...although you may be some time waiting as my updates will be sporadic at best!
